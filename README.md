SimSpin v2.0.4 - A package for producing mock observations of particle simulations

The purpose of the SimSpin R-package is to take a particle simulation of a galaxy and produce a spectral data cube in the style of a specified Integral Field Spectroscopy (IFS) instrument.

A mock spectral data cube can be produced using the functions in this package. This is a simple process comprised of three steps:

  1. Read in your particle data and produce the relevant spectra using the `make_simspin_file` function.
  1. Setup the observation by defining your `telescope` and `observing_strategy`.
  1. Build your data cube using the `build_datacube`.

From this cube, "observables" can be measured using observational pipelines. Specifically, the observed line-of-sight velocities and dispersions. This package, once installed, is fully documented and tested.

Another implementation of this code (SimSpin v1.1.3) written in Julia is also available at [SimSpin.jl](https://github.com/kateharborne/SimSpin.jl) developed by [Gerry Gralton](https://github.com/gerrygralton). 

A further python implementation of SimSpin v2.0.0 is also in development at [PySimSpin](https://github.com/kateharborne/PySimSpin).

## Package installation

To install directly into R:
```
> install.packages("devtools")
> library(devtools)
> install_github("kateharborne/SimSpin")
```
Else, please `fork` a copy of this repository for your own development using the `code` button to the upper right. 

## Package examples

The following lines will take you from a particle simulation of a galaxy, an example of which is included in this package, through to the production of a mock-IFS data cube. 

```
ss_file = make_simspin_file(filename = system.file("extdata","SimSpin_example_Gadget",
                                                    package = "SimSpin"),
                            write_to_file = FALSE) # generate a spectra file
SAMI = telescope(type="SAMI")                      # initialise a telescope
strategy = observing_strategy(z = 0.05)            # initialise obsering conditions

cube = build_datacube(simspin_file = ss_file,      # build data cube
                      telescope = SAMI,
                      observing_strategy = strategy)
                            
```
For a longer example of how each function can be used, please take a look at the documentation for the package. Short examples for each function are provided in each function's documentation, as well as an explanation of each of the possible input variables. 

From within R, you can display the package documentation by typing `?SimSpin` and select "Index" at the bottom of the page to view all available functions. Alternatively, type `?` followed by the function name to see function specific documentation. 

Longer examples are published [here](https://rpubs.com/kateharborne) and demonstrate a walk-through the basic code operation for SimSpin v2.0.0 (and v1.1.3).

If you have any further questions or requests for features in the code, report an issue or drop an email to katherine.harborne@uwa.edu.au.
