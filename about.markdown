# SimSpin v2.X.X
{: .fs-9 }

A package for producing mock observations of simulations
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 .mb-3 .lh-tight }

{: .pl-4 .pb-1 } 

SimSpin was written as part of the PhD Thesis "From Particles to Pixels: Using numerical simulations to investigate observable galaxy kinematics" by K.E. Harborne (2020). 
{: .fs-5 .fw-300 }

This code has since evolved to both construct *kinematic* and *spectral* data cubes, as denoted by the upgrade to version 2.X.X.

SimSpin has been used for a number of research publications including:

-  ["The diverse nature and formation paths of slow rotator galaxies in the EAGLE simulations"](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.509.4372L/abstract)(2022) *C.D.P. Lagos, E. Emsellem, J. van de Sande, **K.E. Harborne**, L. Cortese, T. Davison, C. Foster and R. Wright*, 
-  ["The MAGPI survey: Science goals, design, observing strategy, early results and theoretical framework"](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021PASA...38...31F/abstract)(2021) *C. Foster, J.T. Mendel, C.D.P. Lagos, E. Wisnioski, T. Yuan, F. D'Eugenio, T. M. Barone, **K.E. Harborne** and others*
