  In this work, we present a methodology and a corresponding
  code-base for constructing mock integral field
  spectrograph (IFS) observations of simulated galaxies in a
  consistent and reproducible way. Such methods are
  necessary to improve the collaboration and comparison of
  observation and theory results, and accelerate our
  understanding of how the kinematics of galaxies evolve
  over time. This code, SimSpin, is an open-source package
  written in R, but also with an API interface such that the
  code can be interacted with in any coding language.
  Documentation and individual examples can be found at the
  open-source website connected to the online repository.
  SimSpin is already being utilised by international IFS
  collaborations, including SAMI and MAGPI, for generating
  comparable data sets from a diverse suite of cosmological
  hydrodynamical simulations.
