\usage{
make_simspin_file(
  filename,
  cores = 1,
  disk_age = 5,
  bulge_age = 10,
  disk_Z = 0.024,
  bulge_Z = 0.001,
  template = "BC03lr",

  half_mass = NA,
  sph_spawn_n = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{filename}{The path to the snapshot file.}

\item{cores}{The number of cores across which to multi-thread the problem.}

\item{disk_age}{The age of the disk particles in Gyr.}

\item{bulge_age}{The age of the bulge particles in Gyr.}

\item{disk_Z}{The metallicity of the disk particles in Gyr.}

\item{bulge_Z}{The metallicity of the bulge particles in Gyr.}

\item{template}{The stellar templates from which to derive the SEDs. Options
include "BC03lr" (GALEXEV low resolution, Bruzual & Charlot 2003), "BC03hr"
(GALEXEV high resolution, Bruzual & Charlot 2003) or "EMILES" (Vazdekis et
al, 2016).}

\item{write_to_file}{Boolean to specify whether the list produced should be
written to a ".Rdata" file or output to the environment. Default is TRUE, so
that files can be re-observed without having the generate spectra each time.}

\item{output}{The path at which the output file is written. If not provided,
file will be written at the location of the input filename with the addition
of "_spectra.Rdata".}

\item{overwrite}{If true, and the file already exists at the output location,
a new file will be written over the old one.}

\item{centre}{If simulation file contains all particles cutout from a box
(rather than just particles from a single galaxy), you can specify the point
around which the view should be centred. Numeric length = 3. Default is NA,
in which case the system is centred around the median position.}

\item{half_mass}{If simulation file contains all particles cutout from a box
(rather than just particles from a single galaxy), you can the half-mass
value at which the alignment function is run. Numeric length = 1. Default is
NA, in which case half the total mass of the suplied simulation data is used.}

\item{sph_spawn_n}{Numeric describing the number of gas particles with which
to sample the SPH smoothing length. Default is 1, which will not spawn
additional gas particles. Increasing this value increases the number of
particles used to model the gas distribution. This value may need to be
tested for convergence depending on the resolution of the grid used to image
the gas properties at the `build_datacube()` stage.}
}
\value{
Returns an .Rdata file that contains a list of particle positions,
velocities, and spectra (or a list containing the same information to the
environment without writing to file, when `write_to_file = F`).
}
\description{
The purpose of this function is to construct a SimSpin file containing the
mock spectra for each particle contained within the galaxy simulation file.
If the snapshot provided is from a cosmological simulation, the SEDs
generated will be with respect to the Stellar Formation Time/Age, Metallicity
and Initial Mass of each stellar particle. If the system is an N-body model,
stellar particles are assumed to have an age and metallicity as provided to
the function as \code{disk_age}, \code{bulge_age}, \code{disk_Z} and
\code{bulge_Z}. Returned is an .Rdata file in a SimSpin readable format.
