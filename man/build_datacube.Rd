\usage{
build_datacube(
  simspin_file,
  telescope,
  observing_strategy,
  verbose = F,
  write_fits = F,

  object_name = "GalaxyID_unknown",

)
}
\arguments{
\item{simspin_file}{The path to the location of the SimSpin .Rdata file OR
output list from \code{make_simspin_file()}.}

\item{telescope}{An object of the telescope class describing the
specifications of the observing telescope (i.e. field of view, spatial
resolution, wavelength resolution, etc.).}

\item{observing_strategy}{An object of the observing_strategy class that
describes the properties of the observed simulation (i.e. redshift,
inclination, seeing conditions).}

\item{verbose}{Default is \code{FALSE}. If you would like the code to give
updates about its progress, change this parameter to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{write_fits}{Default is \code{FALSE}. If you would like the code to
output a FITS file, change this parameter to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{output_location}{Optional parameter that describes the path to the FITS
file output if \code{write_fits = TRUE}. If \code{write_fits = TRUE} and no
\code{output_location} is specified, the FITS file will be written to the
same directory as the input \code{simspin_file}.}

\item{object_name}{Optional string used in \code{write_simspin_FITS} to
describe the name of the object observed in FITS header.}

\item{telescope_name}{Optional string used in \code{write_simspin_FITS} to
describe the name of the telescope used for observation in FITS header.}

\item{observer_name}{Optional string used in \code{write_simspin_FITS} to
describe the name of the person who ran the observation in FITS header.}

\item{cores}{Float describing the number of cores to run the interpolation
and velocity gridding on. Default is 1.}

\item{mass_flag}{Boolean flag that, when set to TRUE, will compute properties
using a mass weighting rather than a luminosity weighting. Default is FALSE.}
}
\value{
Returns an .fits file that contains a the generated spectral cube and
relevant header describing the mock observation.
}
\description{
The purpose of this function is to generate a mock IFU data cube from
a SimSpin file, as generated using the \code{make_simspin_file()} function.
The data cube produced can be either a spectral cube or a velocity cube.
