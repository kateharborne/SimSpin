# Not a fan of R? Why not use the API.

In 2022, SimSpin was awarded development time with [Astronomy Data and Computing Services (ADACS)](https://adacs.org.au/who-we-are/) to build a web interface for working with the code. This application is a performant React Single Page App communicating asynchronously with a RESTful API to access the SimSpin package. 

[Launch the app!](https://simspin.datacentral.org.au/app/){: .btn .btn-purple }
{: .lh-tight }

You can access the API directly, however, and run commands from Python using the example below. 
{: .fs-5 .fw-300 .pb-2 }
