| 25/01/23 | *Bug fix.* Addressing issues #76 and #77. When working with the BC03 templates, the first AgeBin was labeled 0 Gyr. This was causing a problematic log10() age bin when gridding up the templates to match to the stellar ages within the model such that any stars that fell into this bin were associated with spectra of NA's. This was not clear until testing with IllustrisTNG galaxies that have very young stars in the outputs. Now fixed by setting low age bins to non-zero values (i.e. 0 Gyr -> 1e-9 Gyr). Tests and documentation updated for these changes. | 2.4.4 | | Alice Serene & Kate Harborne |
| 17/01/23 | *Bug fix.* Addressing issue #12. When a hydrodynamical simulation HDF5 is input without a `RunLabel` in the header, the file is processed like an N-body model (often meaning that no stellar particles are read in.) Catches added to stop the code with meaningful error if this is the case. Further interpretation added for named datasets in Hydro default names rather than expected. | 2.4.3 | 44b703304efde31d08fd8e857f986fc93879b3ee | Kate Harborne |
| 16/01/23 | **New feature!** Update to add support for IllustrisTNG. Updates to `make_simspin_file`, `utilities`, and tests were implemented. | 2.4.2 | 5fb9ad5803f26bc1dad81f9818dff24225f4e1d0 | Alice Serene |
| 28/10/22 	| *Bug fix.* Addressing issue #72. Output fluxes are much higher than they should be due to an improper scaling of SSP templates wrt stellar particle mass.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  	| 2.4.1   	| ef171e40626edacc350c1e119cc6f807c6335529 | Kate Harborne |
| 30/09/22 	| Tagging a release for the SimSpin web app. This update has no code developments from the previous version. Stable version.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               	| 2.4.0   	| 9307ffb7b1775540426966eb2903da119c6d7495   | Kate Harborne |
| 15/09/22 	| *Minor bugfix.* Addressing issue #69 (nee #59 which was not actually fixed in previous attempts!). Removing final long entry ("aperture_region") from OBS_TABLE so that entries are never too long to be written to a FITS table.                                                                                                                                                                                        	| 2.3.17  	| 95c1687a4f7af47ef458d1faf191281e0f9f6121 	| Kate Harborne |
| 24/08/22 	| *Minor bugfix*. Addressing issue #66. Prior to v2.3.16, gas particle SFRs have been stored in units of g/s rather than Msol/yr. This has been fixed within the `make_simspin_file` function from v2.3.16 and any SimSpin files \< v2.3.16 will now issue a warning when building a gas observation with `build_datacube` and `method = 'gas'` and adjust the SFR units. Other updates include:                           	| 2.3.16  	| 8e0f382a825791cd2026c72c8eefea9006d75f11 	| Kate Harborne |
|          	| (1) Warnings issued when method requested is not possible with the input SimSpin file (i.e. `method = "gas"` when the file contains no stellar particles.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                	|         	|                                          	| |
|          	| (2) Warnings issued if you request a half-mass radius alignment with an n-body input simulation (as these are now not aligned by default).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               	|         	|                                          	| |
|          	| (3) Addition of `filter_name` to `telescope` for clarity in the output observation table.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                	|         	|                                          	| |
| 12/08/22 	| *Minor bugfix*. Addressing issue #64. Galaxy simulations will not be `align`ed if the input is from an 'nbody' simulation. This avoids the flip/flop effect in between snapshot time steps. Other changes include the default for `signal-to-noise` to be set to `NA` for ease in the SimSpin app. If no value is specified, no noise will be added to the observation. This is now updated also in the documentation.   	| 2.3.15  	| 74b569992f3db0b1d0b5a46c06e64d510479e94b 	| Kate Harborne |
| 03/08/22 	| *Minor bugfix*. Addressing issue #60. Ensuring that raw images produced for any stellar mode observations (i.e. `method="spectral"` or `method="velocity"`) are consistent. New images added to spectral mode outputs (age and metallicity summaries) and all updated to mass weighted quantities.                                                                                                                       	| 2.3.14  	| 6ab467718664be1db0fa653b0fb219d073472d43 	| Kate Harborne |
| 01/08/22 	| *Minor bugfix*. Addressing Issue #59 (which was not actually fixed in previous attempt!). Making sure long entries (i.e. wave_seq, vbin_seq or sbin_seq) are never too long to be written to a FITS table. Change to range (i.e. min and max) to remove this as an issue.                                                                                                                                                	| 2.3.13  	| eee7c31c8686a5056ff3419136cb384d40693e50 	| Kate Harborne |
| 29/07/22 	| *Minor bugfix*. Addressing Issue #59. Making sure any NA values within the `observation` list are re-written as "None" in characters before writing to FITS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             	| 2.3.12  	| 91e8e890e3154169b7bb078e80efe979c006667b 	| Kate Harborne |
| 28/07/22 	| *Minor bugfix*.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          	| 2.3.11  	| c7114e4727e7eb2396d9af075c85df17b6c950e2 	| Kate Harborne |
|          	| (1) Update to `write_simspin_FITS`. The `observation` summary output by `build_datacube` was previously never saved to the FITS file output. However, this makes it difficult to reproduce if the only saved output is a FITS file. With this update, the list `observation` is now written to a table in EXTNUM = 3 for all FITS files produced.                                                                        	|         	|                                          	| |
|          	| (2) Update to `method = "gas"`. Particle images will now be output when method is `gas`, along with both the raw and observed mass, velocity and dispersion maps. This mode was not updated with the `spectral` and `velocity` modes in v2.3.8 upgrade. This has now been remedied.                                                                                                                                      	|         	|                                          	| |
|          	| (3) Addition of plotting functions for the gas mode specific images: `plot_SFR` and `plot_OH`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           	|         	|                                          	| |
| 27/07/22 	| *Minor bugfix.* Update to `make_simspin_file` to increase the level of compression for output files. This will have no change on functions down the line. Also, fixed the units for `plot_h4` which was writing "km/s" when there are no units for h4.                                                                                                                                                                   	| 2.3.10  	| be0c281cb69f7352d3a88f59f7777bbffdc149d6 	| Kate Harborne |
| 22/07/22 	| **New feature!** Update to add plotting functions. A suite of functions with standard colour maps for each image type: `plot_flux`, `plot_mass`, `plot_velocity`, `plot_dispersion`, `plot_h3`, `plot_h4`, `plot_age`, `plot_metallicity` and `plot_particles`. Axis names and colour bars can be modified by the user. All new functions are tested and documented.                                                     	| 2.3.9   	| 2aceb04d6e40196168de13c4bbd450280de46c4d 	| Kate Harborne |
| 21/07/22 	| *Minor bugfix*. With update to v2.3.5, flux conservation was implemented in mode="velocity". During this upgrade, filters were properly implemented meaning that re-run observations will now produce flux maps = 0 where previously they had flux. This occurs when the filter wavelength range does not overlap with the observed telescope wavelength range.                                                          	| 2.3.8   	| e043f8302ea8f5d0ac189a44edf33b6ceb866f50 	| Kate Harborne |
|          	| (1) Errors now issued by `telescope` if you request a filter that will not allow any flux through the telescope wavelength range.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        	|         	|                                          	| |
|          	| (2) Default filter has been changed in `telescope` to `filter = "g"` so that there is overlap between the default parameters.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            	|         	|                                          	| |
|          	| (3) Errors issued if the requested `half_mass` in `make_simspin_file` is greater than the total mass contained in the input simulation file OR if smaller than the mass of a single particle.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            	|         	|                                          	| |
|          	| (4) All images are now written to FITS (not just a selection dependent on the method selected).

| 19/07/22 	| **New feature!** Update to `build_datacube`. Observed images produced with method = 'velocity' now include measured h3 and h4 higher order kinematics. This is done by fitting the LOSVD within the output velocity cube with a Gauss-Hermite polynomial. These images are now included and written to single or split FITS.                                                                                             	| 2.3.7   	| 2dbca740c29637f8802f1c92ce48ca0b215f5458 	| Kate Harborne |

Addresses Issue #42. Also, made observational images consistent with raw images (removing NAs and replacing with 0's).                                                                                                                             	| 2.3.3   	| e4ca02bf3ab482a0fd9a1abd6e2442c0e4a41da4 	| Kate Harborne |
| 27/06/22 	| *Minor bugfix*. Updating `build_datacube` to make sure backwards compatibility. If a SimSpin file from versions preceading v2.3.0 are used with the function, it now assumes a header based on the wavelength information. This will also issue a warning to explain and encourage the user to remake their SimSpin file. Errors if custom template is used with no details of LSF or wave_res.

| 20/06/22 	| *Minor bugfix*. Updating `telescope` class to allow two modes of spatial resolution of the MUSE telescope. This addresses Issue #43. Similarly, we've added the requirement for the MUSE field-of-view to be less than 60" and for MaNGA fov to be from the specific selection of options (12, 17, 22, 27, 32).                                                                                                          	| 2.3.1   	| dbba3af4c926e9c8c9e2a650d22dee2bf0d0f837 	| Kate Harborne |

|          	| (1) Output SimSpin files now include an additional `header` element describing the code version with which the file was made, the properties and name of the template used to derive particle spectra, and the type of input simulation.                                                                                                                                                                                 	|         	|                                          	| |
|          	| (2) The LSF treatment in `build_datacube` has been modified to account for the fact that the underlying spectral templates have a LSF themselves, and it is only necessary to convolve these up by the mean-square difference between the teescope LSF and the input template.                                                                                                                                           	|         	|                                          	| |

|          	| (1) `method` of observation is now specified directly in the `build_datacube` function - rather than within `telescope()`. This means that a given telescope can be specified once, while the type of cube being built can be modified. This is more logical as an inbuilt telescope type now only needs to be specified by "type".                                                                                      	|         	|                                          	| |
|          	| (2) `output_location` has modified behaviour to allow a user to just specify an output PATH (rather than having to auto-save FITS to the same directory as the input SimSpin file).

|          	| (1) Allow user to specify the 'pointing' of the telescope relative to the centre of the galaxy. Can be specified using (x,y) offsets in kpc (`pointing_kpc`) or deg (`pointing_deg`). Useful for observing galaxies that are closer to the observer than the aperture width allows for the full object to be seen in one observation.                                                                                    	|         	|                                          	| |
|          	| (2) Modification to input names. Specifying projected distance can now be done in terms of redshift distance, physical distance (i.e. in Mpc) or angular scale (i.e. specifying kpc per arcsecond). These are now called `dist_z`, `dist_Mpc` and `dist_kpc_per_arcsec`. See `?observing_strategy` for more details.                                                                                                     	|         	|                                          	| |
|          	| (3) Break changes avoided by still allowing users to specify `z` to indicate projected distance. A depreciation warning will also be issues when specifying `z` rather than `dist_z` however.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            	|         	|                                          	| |

|          	| (1) When blurring velocity cubes, objects were being returned with the name `spectral_cube` despite the v2.0.4 updates.
